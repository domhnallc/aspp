E-prints system doesn't have a software type, only other or artefact

Exeter= software doesnt appear as a type to search by.  But you can set Type = software.  This reveals 23 software cats.




Nottingham has an explicit section for Open Software in its general research pages 

"Software that is created during the course of your research, either as a way of analysing your data, or as a research output in itself, can be shared openly similarly to sharing data or journal articles.

Software requires different licenses to other open research outputs to allow you to differentiate between sharing a compiled program, and sharing the underlying code. Further details can be found on Choose a License. Software can be shared through the UoN data repository or through external platforms such as GitHub or Open Science Framework."

NOTE- it doesn't have 'software' as a type in its search




JISC has IRUS https://irus.jisc.ac.uk/r5/report/item/irus_ir_master/ that can track downloads etc.  Doesn't have a software type.
IRUS item types

"Item types are not part of the COUNTER standard but are an additional feature of IRUS. So that we can provide consistent and comparable reports across repositories, we map the descriptions supplied by repositories to a controlled list of IRUS item types.

{unspecified} indicates that either a repository has not specified an item type or we have not yet established a mapping between the source item type and our list of IRUS item types."

Actually, looking at the R5 protocol 'item types policy' there is no software. https://irus.jisc.ac.uk/r5/about/policies/item_types/#current_item_types_policy

It Says
7 Updated proposals for usage of item types in IRUS-UK
Following both an examination of the new guidelines and their mapping to the current IRUS-
UK item types (see Appendix 8) and an examination of the use of the IRUS-UK item types
since their inception (see Appendices 10 and 11), it is proposed that we slightly modify the
item types used by IRUS-UK to remove ‘Journal’ and ‘Review’ and to split ‘Conference or
Workshop Item’ into three categories. Thus:
The IRUS-UK list will contain the following item types: Art/Design Item; Article; Audio;
Book; Book Section; Conference Papers /Posters; Conference Proceedings; Conference or
Workshop Item – Other; Dataset; Exam Paper; Image; Learning Object; Moving Image;
Music/Musical Composition; Other; Patent; Performance; Preprint; Report;
Show/Exhibition; Text; Thesis or Dissertation; Unknown; Website; Working Paper.
12As the original item types continue to be stored for each download, it will be possible to
remap types to expand or amend this list over time.
In addition, we are starting a pending list of item types that we are considering for inclusion
in the future if their usage becomes significant. We have been asked to consider the
inclusion of ‘Code’ as an item type. None of our current participants uses that but some use
the term ‘Software’ so we have added this to our pending list.
